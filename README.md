# #1 PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

**Was challenging and fun.**

The website without _responsive.css_ is as close as I did to the original design-mockup.\
At first glance I thought it looks so easy, but than I realized it's more complicated.

## The sections of the website

- Html
  - Head
  - Body
    - Header
    - Main
      - Cover
      - Projects
      - About
      - Social
      - Footer

`<code>my favourite hidden element from the course so far</code>`


## What was hard:

* Responsive images using `srcset`. Still didn't manage to control it correctly.
* Align to center. So many options:
  - justify-content: center;
  - align-content: center;
  - align-self: center;
  - align-items: center;
  - box-align:
  - justify-items: center;
  - vertical-align: center;
* Getting padding and margin correctly.

## What I was happy to learn:

* Planing the website on a papers as a tree (it's came naturaly from the first leason)
* Make good spacing adaptations + using simple math aka `calc()`
* Everything else. Was great, *Thanks!*
