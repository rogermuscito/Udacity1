# PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

This is a sample of portfolio website using plan HTML and CSS.

## The sections of the website

- Html
  - Head
  - Body
    - Header
    - Main
      - Cover
      - Projects
      - About
      - Social
      - Footer

## File system

The website turns responsive with _responsive.css_.

## Notes for my future self:

* Work on responsive images using `srcset` to learn to control it correctly.
* Align to center. Read about:
  - justify-content: center;
  - align-content: center;
  - align-self: center;
  - align-items: center;
  - box-align:
  - justify-items: center;
  - vertical-align: center;
* Do padding and margin correctly.
